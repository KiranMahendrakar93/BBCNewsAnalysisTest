That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot. Meyer's constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge. Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer was born on 27 October, 1920. Educated at Eton, and at New College, Oxford, he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy. He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament. His prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line.\\n\",\n          \"US prepares for hybrid onslaught\\n\\nSales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research suggests.\\n\\nResearch group JD Power estimates sales will hit 200,000 in 2005, despite higher prices and customer scepticism. Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.\\n\\nAt the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their \\\"green\\\" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year.\\n\\nHonda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV.\\n\\nOthers remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \\\"We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\\\" Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. \\\"We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\\\" Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. \\\"The average consumers aren't willing to pay that premium for a car they won't drive more than six years,\\\" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power.\\n\",\n          \"BA to suspend two Saudi services\\n\\nBritish Airways is to halt its flights from London Heathrow to Jeddah and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia from 27 March.\\n\\nThe airline said the decision was a commercial one due to reduced passenger demand for the services. BA currently operates four flights per week from Heathrow to Jeddah, and three weekly journeys to Riyadh. It suspended flights to Saudi Arabia for three weeks in autumn 2003 after a government warning about a \\\"threat to UK aviation interests in Saudi Arabia\\\".\\n\\nBA will now suspend the Saudi flights - which it says will remain \\\"under constant review\\\" - from 27 March. \\\"The decision to suspend flights between the UK and Saudi Arabia is a difficult one to make as we have enjoyed a long history of flying between the two countries,\\\" said BA director of commercial planning, Robert Boyle. \\\"However, the routes don't currently make a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain them while this remains the case.\\\" Passengers with flights booked after the suspension date will be contacted by BA for alternative arrangements to be made.\\n\"\n

280 schemes by incomes data services ids said employer contributions had increased from 5.5bn to 8.2bn a year a rise of 49.7 . companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100 or more ids said. many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open because of rising costs and increased liabilities. a final salary scheme also known as a defined benefit scheme promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire. the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase or defined contribution schemes. these are less risky for employers. under money purchase schemes employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity a policy which pays out an income until death on retirement. ids said there were some schemes in good health. but in many cases firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle yawning deficits . the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. in 1998 99 for example contributions rose by 4.7 and in 2002 03 by 8.6 . in contrast between 1996 and 1998 some employers cut their contribution levels. helen sudell editor of the ids pensions service said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by ids. we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision said ms sudell. with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes. \",\n          \"attack prompts bush site block the official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons . the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective. many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses. the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website. scott stanzel a spokesman for the bush cheney campaign said the measure was taken for security reasons. he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. the barring of non us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. in early october a so called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs. the attack made the site unusable for about five hours. about the same time the web team of the bush cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. akamai uses a web based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based. typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name. ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site. the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney have failed. by contrast netcraft is four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. mike prettejohn netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however simply blocking non us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military is own portion of the net. akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text_length\",\n      \"properties\":

extended to apply to children from other countries. children is charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children is best interests if it reunites them with their communities. the pilot included in the government is five year immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylum seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims. since 2002 at least 9 000 under 18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanian born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families should they be traced or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country. under the 1989 children act public bodies have a duty to act in the best interest of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns not least because of the well documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania. if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis she said. we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania . if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision. in its five year immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot . we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman. we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it is possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable. we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with children is legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities. the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said. but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg. in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries. a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.

has again refused to retract a nazi insult made to a jewish reporter. labour is mr livingstone who says he is standing by his remarks had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard . at his weekly press conference on tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. he said to media representatives if you think they are racist i think you are wrong. the mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs who arrived in london on tuesday. i think it is important that the ioc international olympic committee members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget he said. on tuesday the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. two motions were passed by the london assembly which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor is activities on monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments. the mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of examples of intrusion by journalists into his and his family is private life. i do not suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history. but when reporters say to me i am only doing this because it is my job... that is the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard. we are responsible for our own choices in this life i always have been and so have reporters. an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the board of deputies of british jews demanding an investigation by the standards board of england. it has the power to suspended or bar him from office but mr livingstone said there must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years. i have never in response to any of that modified a policy i believed to be right or modified a position i believed to be right and i do not intend to now. because if i do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers. on tape mr livingstone who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper is heard asking reporter oliver finegold if he is a german war criminal . mr finegold replies no i am jewish i was not a german war criminal. i am quite offended by that. the mayor then says ah right well you might be but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard you are just doing it because you are paid to

an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord woolf published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation he said. but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said. in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines. i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending. director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said.

details of the coming week is events were hammered out at a meeting at mr kilroy silk is buckinghamshire home on sunday the bbc news website was told. the news came after ukip suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston 54 was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. ukip asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down. mr hockney meanwhile told the bbc i believe that robert kilroy silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the uk independence party. on the suspension of mr houston ukip said those who selected him knew nothing of his views. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to law abiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said we are looking for the resurrection of the british empire. the problems for the human race environmental and others can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the english speaking nations which they are uniquely able to do. ukip spokesman mark croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston is reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not. \n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","T5_summary:\n"," uk independence party has
